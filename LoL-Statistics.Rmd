### MatchStatsTbl.csv

Import code and print off column and row count
```{r import}
match_stats <- read.csv("data/MatchStatsTbl.csv")
row_count <- nrow(match_stats)
col_count <- ncol(match_stats)
cat("There are", row_count, "rows.\n")
cat("There are", col_count, "columns.\n")
```

```{r clean}
names <- colnames(match_stats)
print(names)
```

```{r sort and cycle}
library(ggplot2)

# create data
# data <- data.frame(xValue,yValue)

# Plot
ggplot(match_stats, aes(x = TotalGold, y = DmgDealt)) + geom_line()
# Makes sure all numbers are proper
# for (i in 1:row_count) {
#   total <- match_stats$Win[i]
#   print(total)
# }
```

dmgDealt = match_stats$DmgDealt
Q1 = quantile(dmgDealt, 0.25)
Q3 = quantile(dmgDealt, 0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

lowerBound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upperBound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

filtered = match_stats[dmgDealt >= lowerBound & dmgDealt <= upperBound & match_stats$PrimaryKeyStone != '0' & match_stats$Lane != "NONE", ]

#2 Way ANOVA on Keystone and Role
filtered$PrimaryKeyStone = factor(filtered$PrimaryKeyStone)
filtered$Lane = factor(filtered$Lane)
model = aov(DmgDealt ~ PrimaryKeyStone * Lane, data=filtered)
summary(model)
#Results show a high F value meaning that KeyStone has a large effect on average damage even with the large amount of noise (random player variation still makes most of the difference)
#P-Values all very low so all very signifigant
#Residuals are very high, meaning that KeyStone and Lane are primarily not the biggest effects and most is left up to other factors(Likely player randomness and maybe gold earned)

#Find Individual stats
KeyStoneStats = TukeyHSD(model, "PrimaryKeyStone")
KeyStoneStats
LaneStats = TukeyHSD(model, "Lane")
LaneStats
#NEED TO DO: GRAPH AND VISULIZE DATA PROPERLY
