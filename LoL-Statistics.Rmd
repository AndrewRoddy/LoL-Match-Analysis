## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
team_match <- read.csv("data/TeamMatchTbl.csv")
row_count <- nrow(team_match)
col_count <- ncol(team_match)
cat("There are", row_count, "rows.\n")
cat("There are", col_count, "columns.\n")
```
