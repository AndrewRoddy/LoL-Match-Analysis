## League of Legends Crash Course {.center}

What is League of Legends?


![Also known as "League" and "LoL".](img/lol-logo.png){width="50%"}



## Components 


Six main components

 - champions
 - teams
 - towers
 - minions
 - gold
 - nexus



## Champions{.center}
Before the game each player selects one of the 172 champions. Each champion has unique abilities and stats.

## The Nexus {.center}
Destroy the opposing teams nexus to win the game. There are problems along the way.

## Towers {.center}
Each team has 9 towers on their side of the map. They must be destroyed to access the Nexus but if the opponent gets too close they attack.

## Minions {.center}

Luckily minions can be used to distract the towers from attacking the players. The minions also drop gold when eliminated.

## Gold {.center}

Gold can be used to purchase items which increase the stats of the champions.

## Data Size {.big-code}
Our analysis uses data from 150,000 matches of player data and 68,000 matches of team data. This means sometimes we will use screenshots from our code instead of running it live.

```{r import}
#| echo: false
match_stats <- read.csv("../data/MatchStatsTbl.csv")
row_count <- nrow(match_stats)
col_count <- ncol(match_stats)
cat("Player Data:\nThere are", row_count, "rows.\n")
cat("There are", col_count, "columns.\n\n")
```

&nbsp;

```{r import2}
team_stats <- read.csv("../data/TeamMatchTbl.csv")
row_count2 <- nrow(team_stats)
col_count2 <- ncol(team_stats)
cat("Team Data:\nThere are", row_count2, "rows.\n")
cat("There are", col_count2, "columns.\n")

library(dplyr)

summoner_match <- read.csv("../data/other/SummonerMatchTbl.csv")
match_stats <- match_stats |>
  left_join(summoner_match, by = c("SummonerMatchFk" = "SummonerMatchId"))

champions <- read.csv("../data/keys/ChampionTbl.csv")
match_stats <- match_stats |>
left_join(champions, by = c("ChampionFk" = "ChampionId"))
```

## Multiple Regression
```{r clean}

# Removes unimportant columns of data
match_stats[, c(
  "item1", "item2", "item3", "item4", "item5", "item6",
  "PrimarySlot1", "PrimarySlot2", "PrimarySlot3",
  "SecondarySlot1", "SecondarySlot2",
  "SummonerSpell1", "SummonerSpell2"
)] <- list(NULL)
```

Multiple regression to test if 
```{r sort and cycle}

library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(car)

# make simple regression model
multiple_regression <- lm(DmgDealt ~
    DmgTaken + TotalGold + MinionsKilled + TurretDmgDealt,
  data = match_stats
)
# Print off if this matters or not
summary(multiple_regression)
```


## Multiple Regression Graph {.big-code}
```{r multiple regression graph}
# Creates the variable plots
#000000 point color
#0.01 : 1 percent opacity

# Commented out for now
avPlots(multiple_regression, col = alpha("#000000", 0.02))
```
